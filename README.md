# Blockchain Engineer Assignment
Filecoin Virtual Machine is now live on Filecoin mainnet. Blockchain developers can build EVM smart contracts either operating directly on their own like on any other EVM chains or interacting with Filecoin built-in actors through the Filecoin Solidity API (a Solidity library that
allows smart contracts to call methods on Filecoin native actors).

## Task
Propose a NFT application design, write a set of smart contracts (>1 contract) on FEVM that interacts with the Filecoin Solidity API, and deploy them to the Hyperspace testnet. 

Please provide test cases and documentation (including a brief explanation to the application design) as well.
